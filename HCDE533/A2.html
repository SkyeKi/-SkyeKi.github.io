            <h1>A2: Parametric Modelling with Grasshopper!</h1>
            <p>
            <h5><dd>Create a parametric model using a grasshopper definition. Using your model, design parts to be laser cut that can be clipped together. At least one of your parts should enable you to connect one of your pieces to another without use of glue or fasteners. Your grasshopper definition should allow you to vary the thickness of your materials, and also vary other design parameters. Include notes in your grasshopper definition so it's clear what a user should input and bake.
                <br>
                Laser cut your parts and construct your physical model. Your physical model should contain at least 30 parts.
                <br>
                Submit the grasshopper definition, your cut files, and a documentation of your laser cut object.

            Used the vase surface made in class as my surface to pattern on. Using sliders segmented it into 12 by 9 segments. I created a shape that had indented slots and the same shape tabs  beyond by bounding box. I extruded the shape in the Z for my pice's thickness before applying it the the vase surface. I then unrolled the baked sufaces before exporting those surfaces as an AI file to cut. Due to fit issues I did out line the shapes by 0.01" to get a better fit. I also rescaled my design for easier manufacturing.

            <br>The device after being calibrated has an blue LED that lights up when it reads a colder tempreture and a red LED that lights up when it reads a warmer tempreture. 
            <br>The Blue LED has a higher voltage drop thus to have the same current in all LEDS the blue LED needs to be paired with a lower resistor of 100 compared to the 220. 1M resistor was used in the voltage divider to prevent short circuts and it was a high number to increase the range of values being detected by the A0 pin.<br>

            The Sensor is warm, value =220<br>


            <h3>Questions: </h3>
            <dd><br>
            <h4>1: In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does it need to be one or the other? Justify your answer with example calculations.</h4><br>
             It can be either as the position of the resistance and voltage are additive in series. The voltage drop across the variable resistor would be the same in either position. The only difference would be the pin that we would be monitering the drop in voltage across the voltage divider would now be monitering the inverse voltage drop across the resistor, being inverted. <br>
             V out = V in *R2/(R1+R2) <br>
             Original position: Vout = 5*1,000,000,000/(R1 + 1,000,000,000) <br>
             Switched position: Vout = 5*R1/(1,000,000,000 + R1) <br>
             1 = R1/(1,000,000,000 + R1) + 1,000,000,000/(R1 + 1,000,000,000) <br>
             <br>
             <h4>2: Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage. Plot the voltage at V-measure of your voltage divider of your shared gif.</h4><br>

             <br>
             <h4>3: AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.</h4><br>
             The current values used to change the LED when writing to it is between 0 and 255 because of the limit of it being 8 bits, if it was 10 bits we could use the values between 0 to 1023. Right now our reading range is from 0 to 1023 but with 16 bits we could get readings from 0 to 65535. These wouldn't measure and give greater reading but insead allow readings to be more specific.<br>
             Our mapping code would instead be map(sensorValue, 0, 65535, 0, 1023) as opposed to the current ranges of map(sensorValue,0,1023,0,255) <br>

            <br>The data sheet for the seven segment dispaly said the forrward current is 20 mili amps so i used a 220 ohm resistor as it was the closest single resitor I could use to get close to that amperage with the 5V. I used only 4 resistors because the digital pins ground the other pins connecting to the seven segment displays and it makes no difference the order of the resistor and the components as long as they are in series.

            <h3>Questions: </h3>
            <dd><br>
            <h4>1: Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. In your loop() you have the following code: for (int i=0, i < 180, i++){servo.write(i); delay(100);}
            Draw a graph with the X axis in seconds, for two seconds, and the y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.</h4><br>
            <img src="4q1.jpg" width=400><br>
            The servo motor's readings are a pulse once per 20ms normally, but due to the delay the pulse would occur only every 0.1 seconds and the duty cycle would be slightly longer with each iteration until i is greater than 180.
             <br>
             <h4>2:  Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous reading 1% of the time. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</h4><br>
             <br>
             new reading = get reading <br>
             if new reading is > 2* old reading or < 0.5 * old reading <br>
             new reading = old reading <br>
             <br>
             use new reading <br>
             <br>
             <h4>3: Your input device is slightly noisy, leading the measurement to randomly deviate from the true measurement up or down by 10%. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</h4><br>
             loop for i = 0; i >= 10 ; i++ <br>
             reading i = get reading <br>
             <br>
             reported reading = average of readings 0 to 9 <br>
             use reported reading as reading <br>
             </dd>

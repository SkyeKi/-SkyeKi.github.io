            <br>The device after being calibrated has an blue LED that lights up when it reads a colder tempreture and a red LED that lights up when it reads a warmer tempreture. 
            <br>The Blue LED has a higher voltage drop thus to have the same current in all LEDS the blue LED needs to be paired with a lower resistor of 100 compared to the 220. 1M resistor was used in the voltage divider to prevent short circuts and it was a high number to increase the range of values being detected by the A0 pin.<br>

            <h4>1: Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. In your loop() you have the following code: for (int i=0, i < 180, i++){servo.write(i); delay(100);} </h4><br>
            Draw a graph with the X axis in seconds, for two seconds, and the y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.<br>

            <h3>Use Case: </h3>
            <br>Soft mood lighting pendent for above my art corner that can be made more bright/ less filtered for when I am working with more small detailed or color sensitive work.

            <h2>Timeline:</h2>
            <br>
            My weeks send to be busier tuesday to friday where I have most of my time focused on other classes, but this time is also when I will be on campus and close to the mill more often. An ideal senario for 3D printing but not more hands on intensive work. That kind of work would be better for saturday through monday when I can have dedicated nonstop hours at a time at the Mill. Based on these factors I planed my work as well as working backwards from the time I would need for documentation and presentation. <br>
            <br>
            15th - 18th: Files and modeling <br>
            The modeling of the parts and files for machining. Only small changes for tolerance allowed past this point unless work is complete.
            19th - 22nd: manufacturing functional<br>
            23rd - 26th: manufacturing improvements<br>
            27th - 29th: Documentation and Presentation<br>
            working on documenting what happened during the process and providing information for others to replicate it on my website. Then working on my final presentation for the 29th, with the rehersing and final tweaks being done on the 29th and the substance being done before. 
            <br>
            <h3>Contingency: </h3>
            <br>
            The hard limit is that all physical work must be done before the 27th, so that documentation can be complete. Thus the main physical work time will be from the 19th to the 26th. I will only allow myself to work on the main functions of the lamp first during the 19th-22nd, and improvements/extras being done from the 22nd onwards only if the main funtionality of the lamp is complete. This ensures more time focused towards having a product, with me hyperfocusing on aspects only if that is first complete. Another way to ensure this is placing a limit on myself for designing any machining/modeling files, I cannot alter them except for tolerances or missing parts past the 22nd, unless the main funtional part is complete. <br>
            <br>
            If any parts do not arrive by the 20th or cannot be picked up by the 22nd, the product must be changed to do so without them even if this means limiting functionality.
            <br>
            All intricate parts must have a less intricate version that must be competed first. For example the outer panels being flat lazer cuts, but the 'better' curved version being done only after those lazer cut ones are. 
            <br>
            If having issue with the 3D printing of panels using L brackets and lazercut wood panels to secure to dowels
            <br>
            <h2>Bill of materials:</h2>
            Lamp parts: reusing from P5
            Acrylic panel: reusing leftover panel from other work 22x16 
            PLA filament: using remainder of the roll
            Hardware to attach pannels to outer ring for movement (shoulder screws) 1 x #panels
            bearings for easier rotation between inner and outer ring.
            Hardware to attach panels to top and bottom sections (dowels) 2 x #panels
            button head screws for securing dowels 2 x #panels 
            L-brackest for contingency 2x #panels
            <br>

            <h3>Sourcing Schedule: </h3>
            <br>
            All online orders must be ordered by thurday the 16th night and other in person materials picked up by Saturday the 18th moring.
